# Pay as you go
Pay As You Go (PAYG) in cloud computing is geared toward organizations and end users. A PAYG user is billed for procured, rather than actual, computing resources. The PAYG mechanism is derived from utility computing.

PAYG allows a user to scale, customize and provision computing resources, including software, storage and development platforms. Resource charges are based on used services, versus an entire infrastructure.
