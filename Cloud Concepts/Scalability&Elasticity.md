# Scalability
Scalability is the ability of the system to adapt to the increase or decrease of workload. In a traditional infrastructire scaling requires provisioning of additional resources but in cloud environments scaling can be done in multiple ways

1. Scaling Up and Down 
2. Scaling in and out
3. AutoScaling

Scaling Up :
Adding resources to existing server when more capacity or performance are needed

Scaling Down :
Removing resources from server when less capacity or performance is required

Scaling Out :
Provisioning additional servers to run the workloads for your applications

Scaling In :
Opposite of scaling out. Deprovisioning of existing servers.

AutoScaling :
Autosscaling is ways to automatically scale your applications such as scaling up\down or scaling in or out as the demand increases or decreases

# Elasticity
Elasticity refers to a systemâ€™s ability to grow or shrink dynamically in response to changing workload demands, like a sudden spike in web traffic.
An elastic system automatically adapts to match resources with demand as closely as possible, in real time. A business that experiences variable and unpredictable workloads might seek an elastic solution in the public cloud.

 A scalable solution enables stable, longer-term growth in a pre-planned manner, while an elastic solution addresses more immediate, variable shifts in demand.
