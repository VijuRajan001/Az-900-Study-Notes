# PaaS

## What is PaaS ?
Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud.
You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.

## Why should organizations go for PaaS Solutions ?
PaaS allows you to avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing software licenses, the underlying application infrastructure and middleware, container orchestrators such as Kubernetes or the development tools and other resources. You manage the applications and services you develop and the cloud service provider typically manages everything else.
