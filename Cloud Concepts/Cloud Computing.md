## Different Types of cloud models

The public cloud allows systems and services to be easily accessible to the general public. Public cloud may be less secure because of its openness.

## Private Cloud
The private cloud allows systems and services to be accessible within an organization. It is more secured because of its private nature.

## Hybrid Cloud
The hybrid cloud is a mixture of public and private cloud, in which the critical activities are performed using private cloud while the non-critical activities are performed using public cloud.

## When to choose private cloud
- Organization that demand strict security, latency, regulatory and data privacy levels.
- Organizations that are highly regulated and need data hosted privately and securely.
- Organizations that are large enough to support the costs that go into running a next-gen cloud data center.
- Organizations that need high-performance access to a filesystem such as in media companies.
- Hosting applications that have predictable usage patterns and demand low storage costs.
- Organizations that demand greater adaptability, configurability, and flexibility.
- Hosting business critical data and applications.

 ## When to choose hybrid cloud
- Large organizations that want the flexibility and scalability as offered by the public cloud.
- Organizations that offer services for vertical markets- customer interactions can be hosted in the Public Cloud while company data can be hosted in the Private Cloud.
- Organizations that demand greater operational flexibility and scalability. For them, mission critical data can be hosted on the Private Cloud and application development and testing can take place in the Public Cloud.

## When to choose public cloud
The Public Cloud offers advantages such as low cost of ownership, automated deployments, scalability and also reliability. The Public Cloud is well suited for the following:

Data storage
Data Archival
Application Hosting
Latency intolerant or mission critical web tiers
On demand hosting for microsite and application.
Auto-scaling environment for large applications.
