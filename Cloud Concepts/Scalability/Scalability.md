# Scalability
Scalability is the ability of the system to adapt to the increase or decrease of workload. In a traditional infrastructire scaling requires provisioning of additional resources but in cloud environments scaling can be done in multiple ways

1. Scaling Up and Down 
2. Scaling in and out
3. AutoScaling

Scaling Up :
Adding resources to existing server when more capacity or performance are needed

Scaling Down :
Removing resources from server when less capacity or performance is required

Scaling Out :
Provisioning additional servers to run the workloads for your applications

Scaling In :
Opposite of scaling out. Deprovisioning of existing servers.

AutoScaling :
Autosscaling is ways to automatically scale your applications such as scaling up\down or scaling in or out as the demand increases or decreases
