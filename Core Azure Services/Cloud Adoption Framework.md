# Cloud Adoption Framework

The Cloud Adoption Framework is proven guidance that is designed to help you create and implement the business and technology strategies necessary for your organisation to succeed in the cloud. It provides best practices, documentation and tools that cloud architects, IT professionals and business decision makers need to successfully achieve their short- and long-term objectives.

Stages :
Define Strategy => Plan => Ready => Adopt
----------------------------------------------
                    Govern | Manage

Some tools to help with financial planning
Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator: Use the TCO calculator to estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your application workloads to Azure.
Azure pricing calculator: Estimate your expected monthly bill by using the pricing calculator.
Azure Cost Management + Billing: Use and manage Azure and other cloud resources through a multiple-cloud cost management solution.

# Define Strategy 

When you define your cloud business strategy, you should consider business impact, turnaround time, global reach, performance, and more. Here are key areas you need to focus on:

Establish clear business outcomes: Drive transparency and engagement for your journey across the organization.
Define business justification: Identify business value opportunities to then select the right technology.

Business criteria: Identify an application currently in operation where the owner has a strong motivation to move to the cloud.
Technical criteria: Select an application that has minimum dependencies and can be moved as a small group of assets.

# Plan
In the plan stage, there are two major actions: rationalizing your digital estate and creating your cloud adoption plan.
In the Plan phase, there are five options for cloud rationalization: rehost, refactor, rearchitect, rebuild/new, and replace. During this process, we recommend that you proceed incrementally.

# Ready
Cloud adoption is a strategic change that requires involvement from both business decision makers and end users.
When you define skills and support readiness, create and implement a skills-readiness plan to address current gaps, ensure that people are ready for the change, and define support needs.
The process of creating your landing zone sets up a migration target in the cloud to handle prioritized applications.

# Adopt

Cloud migration is the process of moving existing digital assets to a cloud platform. Adopt is divided into two different options, migrate and innovate.
Each cloud migration activity is contained during one of the following processes, as it relates to the migration backlog: assess, migrate, optimize, and secure. Then, you manage each backlog asset.
Modernization and innovation in the IT portfolio create tighter alignment with DevOps and accelerate innovations across the digital estate and application portfolio.

# Governance

As your organization moves or deploys new applications to the cloud, it's important to consider these aspects of operating a cloud platform:
Define governance solutions for your cloud environment.
Manage your cloud environment.
The Cloud Adoption Framework governance model identifies key areas of importance. Each area relates to different types of risks the organization must address as it adopts more cloud services. The Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance are Cost Management, Security Baseline, Resource Consistency, Identity Baseline, and Deployment Acceleration.
