# Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed, horizontally partitioned, multi-model database service. The service is designed to allow customers to elastically (and independently) scale throughput and storage across any number of geographical regions. Azure Cosmos DB offers guaranteed low latency at the 99th percentile, 99.99% high availability, predictable throughput, and multiple well-defined consistency models. 

Azure Cosmos DB is flexible. At the lowest level, Azure Cosmos DB stores data in atom-record-sequence (ARS) format. The data is then abstracted and projected as an API, which you specify when you're creating your database. Your choices include SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, and Gremlin. This level of flexibility means that as you migrate your company's databases to Azure Cosmos DB, your developers can stick with the API that they're the most comfortable with.
