In case :
Users need to be able to work from any device from anywhere.
During tax season, short-term employees are hired to be able to meet customer needs and tax deadlines.
Tax software changes from year to year and the organization has some legacy applications that are a challenge to support.
You need to provide a secure, consistent, and performant experience to the apps employees need to do their work.
Azure Virtual Desktop can support all these scenarios and would be a good choice for this organization.
