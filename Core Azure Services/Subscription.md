# Azure Subscriptions

To use Azure's cloud-based services, you must first purchase a subscription. It acts as a single billing unit for Azure resources, with subscriptions billed for services used in Azure.

Azure Subscriptions are global and can contain resources from multiple regions

- An Azure subscription is linked to a single account, the one that was used to create the subscription and is used for billing purposes. Within the subscription, resources can be provisioned as instances of the many Azure products and services.
- You can have more than one subscription, often for billing purposes, since each subscription generates its own set of billing reports and invoices.
- The person who creates an Azure subscription becomes the global administrator for that subscription and has full access to every aspect of that subscription hence separate subscriptions can also be a way to create a division of responsibility for Azure services.

# Getting An Azure Subscription
