# Powershell

Azure PowerShell is a set of cmdlets that allow for manging Azure resources directly from the PowerShell command line. Written in .NET Standard, Azure PowerShell works with PowerShell 5.1 on Windows, and PowerShell 6.x and higher on all supported platforms â€“ including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Starting in December 2018, the Azure PowerShell Az module is in general release and is now the intended PowerShell module for interacting with Azure.
